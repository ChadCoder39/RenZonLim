        "Loft style is a combination of brutal details, such as a brick wall, untreated wooden or even metal beams with new interior elements. The loft style originated in America, when ruined industrial enterprises and warehouses were sold for residential premises. Trying to improve them, creative people created a new extraordinary interior image, which gained popularity almost all over the world.",

        "Prices per square meter of loft style renovation are usually more profitable than any other type of renovation. Therefore, owners of large premises often choose it.",

        "The low price is explained by the fact that:\n- The finishing is rough or absent altogether.\n\n- Walls and ceilings are usually not leveled, but simply painted over the brick or concrete with all its irregularities, drips and stains.\n\n- All kinds of beams, pipes, ventilation systems and the like are not hidden.\n\n- The old heating system is also simply painted over. A fireplace or an old stove can also add a special charm.\n– Floors may remain with traces of abrasions, but the style also allows for replacement of the floor covering.\n– Curtains are often not used.\n– Antique furniture is often used.",

        "The design is characterized by brutality and carelessness, but in tandem with ordinary home furnishings and fashionable design in general, the loft style will ideally reveal the daring, rebellious character and style of its owner.",

        "Scandinavian style has gained wide popularity among the masses due to the symbiosis of functionality, minimalism and the cozy atmosphere that it conveys. As a rule, this style is characterized by light, pastel colors, the walls are mainly white, gray or cream. The floors slightly shade the walls, but also in a warm and light range. So the room seems to be flooded with light, there is a feeling of purity, lightness and transparency. Visually, this approach favorably expands the space. To make the interior lively and interesting, ornaments and decorative plaster are often added.",

        "Soft pillows and a knitted blanket on the sofa, a simple woven rug on the floor add coziness and warmth, macrame is often used as a wall decoration.",

        "The main emphasis is the connection with nature. This is achieved by using natural materials: wood, vines, other plant materials, glass, furniture made of brutal forged metal, natural fabrics, handicrafts and the like. Scandinavian style renovation looks expensive despite the fact that it uses laconic furniture, simple lighting fixtures and a minimum of various interior details.",

        "On the walls, the Scandinavian style allows the use of brick painted in light shades, wooden beams are often used above the ceiling, as in old houses.",

        "Despite all the simplicity of the Scandinavian style, it will be difficult to implement its design and not lose the functionality of the room on your own. With our experience and knowledge of the market of building materials, furniture and interior items, we will professionally help you make an individual renovation project. We carry out renovation and redesign in Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Eindhoven, The Hague and other cities of the Netherlands with high quality and at the most optimal prices.

        "Before you start renovating an old house, you need to inspect it carefully. Make sure it is intact and reliable, so that you don’t have to redo the renovation later.",

        "You need to start with the foundation, walls and roof.",

        "- If there is minor damage, a niche is dug in the weak points of the foundation and filled with concrete, the cracks are eliminated. If the foundation is seriously damaged, it may need to be re-filled. This is a rather complicated and expensive process. Often, the house needs to be placed on additional supports.",

        "- How the wall repair will proceed directly depends on their material and the damage. Sometimes only partial repair is enough, but if the wall is warped, then you will have to re-lay it. And if the wall is also load-bearing, you will also need to support the beams under the roof. When the question is about ennobling the wall from the outside, you can use putty. If the wall is in really bad condition, then it will probably be cheaper to lay a new half-brick masonry on top of it or to improve it with facade panels. Today, their range is quite wide: they imitate the look of brick, wood, stone, etc. In addition, additional cladding allows you to save heat, protect against dampness and mold in the house.",

        "- The roof is replaced partially or completely, depending on the condition. Ideally, glass wool should be laid under the roof. It will serve as an additional barrier to retain heat and dryness in the house, and will also reduce the noise from the rain.",

        "- Replacing the wiring is also an important aspect. Here you need to carefully think through everything at once (the number and location of switches and sockets). The cost of electrical installation work is not cheap, but if the wiring is bad, so that in the future, chasing the walls does not entail additional costs for repairs, it is better not to save on it.",

        "- A plumber is also important for renovation. In old houses, it is advisable to replace metal pipes with plastic ones. They are more reliable. Please pay special attention to the fact that metal often rots in the space between the walls and the ceiling, so it is better to replace the pipes completely, and not just in visible places."

        "The idea of interior design is born not only thanks to good taste. This requires a wealth of knowledge about what materials and products the modern market offers. That is, the field of renovation needs to be thoroughly studied so that the home is not just presentable, but as comfortable and cozy as possible.",

        "In our company, the designer and the team of craftsmen work harmoniously and professionally. However, in order for an individual renovation project to be implemented as accurately as possible, it is not enough to simply give the workers a task; it is also necessary to carry out author's supervision of its implementation. That is, almost every stage of the renovation should be controlled by the designer for compliance with the project. To do this, the designer must directly go to the site and personally check the progress of the work.",

        "In addition, renovation is not always unpredictable. The need for some types of work may arise during others. For example, the owner of the house did not plan to change the tiles, but when replacing the old bathtub with a new one, the old tiles may fall off. We usually warn customers if this is possible.",

        "Also, when redeveloping a house, when a wall is demolished, a lot of unpredictable moments can arise. For example, the floor level in one room may differ significantly from another, then you need to figure out how to hide or eliminate this distortion beautifully. That is, the designer can make additional adjustments during the renovation.",

        "The designer also helps to choose tiles, paint, wallpaper, flooring and other materials taking into account your budget, their quality, practicality and general appearance, so that the entire interior looks harmonious.",

        "Upon completion of the finishing renovation, the designer, taking into account your tastes, will select comfortable and functional furniture, equipment and other interior items that will add to the overall mood of the home, give it character and style."

        "If you need professional painting of walls in Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and any other city in the Netherlands, our specialists are always ready to provide this service qualitatively and inexpensively.",

        "Please note that the price of painting can be supplemented by other related works. For example, before painting, we level the walls or apply plaster, if necessary. We clean the walls from old paint, grease and dust.",

        "Before painting, we prepare the room so as not to stain the floor, switches, sockets and furniture. We prime the walls so that the paint adheres better. We will advise the client on the choice of materials without any problems.",

        "The main criteria when choosing paint are:\n- no harmful chemical compounds;\n- the ability to wash the walls;\n- vapor permeability;\n- wear resistance;\n- quick drying.",

        "The following paints and varnishes are used for finishing walls:\n- Water-based paint. Dries quickly. It has a low price. No pungent odor. There are several types:\n\uF0B7 PVA-based. It is used mainly for the ceiling, since it gets dirty quickly on the walls, and it cannot be washed. It has the lowest cost.\n\uF0B7 Acrylic resin-based. Such paints are more expensive, but they are quite durable. They are suitable for painting walls even in a damp room. Their advantage is also that such a coating allows the wall to \"breathe\".\n\uF0B7 Latex-based. Their price is higher than that of acrylic. The scope of application is wider, since they allow you to work with a textured surface: painting putty and wallpaper.\n\uF0B7 Silicone-based. It is even suitable for the bathtub, since it is completely water-resistant and easy to clean.",

        "– Enamel (alkyd paint). This paint has a specific smell. It holds well, but is not as elastic as acrylic or latex, and therefore not as durable. It cracks much faster and loses its original color, but its price is much lower.",

        "– Silicate paint. Does not change color over time, is not afraid of water and moisture, i.e. is suitable even for the bathroom. It contains liquid glass, which gives additional strength and the ability to cover small cracks. This paint is more expensive, for example, than silicone, but its consumption is very economical."

        "Do you need professional floor repair? The first thing you need to decide on is the material for it. The range of floor coverings today is very wide. Let's consider the most popular:",

        "- Linoleum. The material itself is relatively inexpensive and its installation will also be inexpensive. Such a floor will be warm, it is relatively not afraid of moisture, i.e. it will not deteriorate if water is spilled on it, although it is not advisable to lay it in a bathtub. Of the minuses - a tendency to mechanical damage. For example, it can be pressed in by heels, furniture and the like. It can also be damaged due to thermal exposure. There are many types of linoleum. As a rule, more expensive options are more durable and stronger.",

        "- Ceramic tiles. The best option for the bathroom, since the tiles do not accumulate moisture. They are not afraid of any chemical cleaning and friction. Unless it can be broken by a strong impact or the fall of something heavy. On the other hand, professional tile repair will cost less than re-laying the entire floor. Another disadvantage of ceramics is that it is cold, although it is quite compatible with heated floors, so you can lay tiles throughout the house in any room. In addition, ceramics do not burn, which also makes it a good option for kitchen flooring. - Porcelain tiles. Similar in properties to ceramic tiles. Also made on the basis of clay, but the composition and manufacturing technology are different. Porcelain tiles are more resistant to damage and moisture, have more varieties, including wood, stone, etc. - Laminate. This is a warm material similar to natural wood, but much cheaper. Such a floor makes the interior more comfortable and solid. When laying it, it is important that the floor is perfectly flat, a backing is placed under the laminate, the quality of which will depend on the heat and sound insulation. Cheap laminate can be greatly deformed by moisture. Accordingly, this will affect the appearance and create creaks. If you want your floor to last a long time and look good, it is important to choose the right laminate and underlay, our experts will help you choose materials from trusted manufacturers and provide professional laminate installation services. - Parquet board and parquet. One of the most expensive materials, but also the most durable. Parquet can be easily restored: sanded, use new coatings to not only refresh the look, but also change the color of the floor. This is an environmentally friendly material, very warm, has noise and heat-insulating properties. It looks stylish and expensive."

And from the outside, the house will look expensive and respectable.",

        "Landscape design is a rather complex process, as designers must have not only taste in the selection of plants, but also have good information about the correct conditions for their cultivation. That is, to know what kind of soil a particular plant likes. It needs more light, shade or partial shade. Know the strength and speed of growth of trees and flowers in order to understand how tall they will be, so that they look harmonious at the peak of growth.",

        "It is also necessary to correctly select plants according to the stages of flowering, so that the garden pleases the eye with new colors throughout the warm season. Don't forget about evergreen trees and shrubs, so that even in winter the yard doesn't look gray and dull.",

        "Plants often play not only a decorative role, but also a practical one. For example, they can be used for a hedge, to shade the area in the right places. After all, even a small vegetable garden or fruit trees can be planted beautifully, and then enjoy the harvest.",

        "Landscape design also includes various kinds of structures and buildings. For example, gazebos, barbecues, garden furniture and fountains, raised beds, paths, rockeries (structures made of flowers and stones). The designer also thinks through the garden lighting system, taking into account all weather factors. We often use lighting fixtures that accumulate solar energy, this will significantly reduce electricity costs.",

The main thing is to think through the optimal locations for their location. The same applies to lighting. One large lamp in the center of the ceiling is much more profitable than spotlights.",

        "- Major redevelopment. Often, it is better to refuse it if the budget is limited. Since, demolition of walls usually entails the need to level the floors, ceiling and contact walls. Although there are exceptions when it is easier to demolish the structure than to try to level and restore it.",

        "- Relief plaster is one of the most expensive ways to finish walls, wallpapering is much more profitable. The price of painting walls often seems even more profitable, but it is worth considering that before painting the walls must be perfectly flat, and such leveling is a very labor-intensive service and, accordingly, not cheap.",
